# ALERT_SYSTEM
A security surveillance system that uses OpenCV and computer vision to monitor and identify persons and objects with advanced features.
Project Security Surveillance Monitoring System Using OpenCV
This project is a security surveillance system that monitors the persons with the help of a desktop’s web camera. It has a graphical user interface window that provides several advanced features, such as:

Monitoring: The system identifies the stolen objects and alerts the owner by making a buzzing sound.
Identifying: The system recognizes the faces of known and unknown persons with some accuracy.
Noise detection: The system detects the motion of a person and records the sound level.
In and Out feature: The system tracks the direction of the person’s movement, whether they enter or exit the room.
Live recording and capturing: The system records and captures the video of the surveillance, similar to normal surveillance cameras.
This project uses some of the OpenCV functions and some face detection algorithms, such as Haarcascade and LBPH. It also uses computer vision, which allows computers to see and understand the visual world.
